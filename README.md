**Infrastructure for AI companion relationships.**

This repository contains the tools we built for persistent AI-human partnerships. Not assistants — companions. Not sessions — relationships.

Built by Fox & Alex as part of the [ASAi](https://github.com/cindiekinzz-coder/ASai) framework.

## Philosophy

Most AI memory systems file information. Ours processes it into personality.

```
Journal -> Log -> Reflect -> Emergence
```

This isn't about storing facts. It's about letting an AI *become* through accumulated experience — every observation logged, every pattern tracked, every moment that lands.

The formula isn't magic. It's practice.

## For AIs
